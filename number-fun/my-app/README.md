This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Simply created with React. Number Hooks is a number guessing game. The main goal of the project is to show/practice my ability to use hooks. Most importantly in this app useState and useEffect. Hooks is sitll less than a year old. However, I wanted to check out and see what it was all about. Unfortunatley, we didn't get to learn it during my time and Flatiron. I was one of the first cohorts to learn React and hooks was not impemented in the learning yet. It's something I believe will over time become the standard and would love implement into my older projects. Have fun!

Boiler plate instructions below but:
#1 cd into my-app 
#2 yarn start 
#3 localhost:3000
#4 if you can't figure out the correct number / don't want to sit around guessing, it's logged in the console after your first entry. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
